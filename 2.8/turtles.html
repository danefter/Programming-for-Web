					<p class="p">Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a shell developed mainly from their ribs.
						Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles)
						and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts.
						There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins.
						They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean.
						Like other reptiles, birds, and mammals, they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater,
						although many species live in or around water.</p>

				<p>Dont go too fast to the turtle, they are very slow.
				Approach them at the same speed you would appraoch a man holding a gun, very slowly then in for the pet.
				They may bit you but that is their way of showing love, believe me, I know.
				I have so many turtle bites they don't let me into the pet store anymore.
				<mark>Turtles love pizza if they are humanoid large crime fightinging turtles in teenage years.</mark>
				As they get older, turtles prefer little nurturing blankets of lettuce and republican radio stations.
				Do not let this confuse you, most turtles are libertarians and prefer a free lifestyle.
				To get them to like you be sure to discuss Ron Paul (he looks like a turtle and is libertarian) and mention things like reduced taxes for turtles.</p>
