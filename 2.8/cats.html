				<p><i>Audio of cat eating</i></p><p class="p">The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
					It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred
					to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
					A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
					Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
					About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

				<p><mark>Cats like catnip and catfood especially things that smell like fish but especially fish or shrimp</mark>.				
				Dont give them cucumbers some cats think they are snakes which is no fun for the cat they get scared. 
				Some cats will bring you mice and birds if they like you be sure to accept them graciously and pretend to eat them.
				If a cat comes up to you let it smell you before you pet as otherwise the cat may consider you to be a threat,
				rather than considering you as inferior, (a little worthless nonhunting food source) which is the ideal relationship with a cat.
				The best is the ancient Egyptians they worshipped cats which made cats like them very much.
				Also they like milk but thats bad.</p>
