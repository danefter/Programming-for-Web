					<p class="p">The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
						Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,
						and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
						The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago,
						before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans,
						dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability
						to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[</p>

				<p><mark>Dogs are like other dogs: they like dogs.
				Dogs like bones. Give them bones and other treats some dogs like treats that arent bones.</mark>
				Give them litte doggy candies and dog food. Some dogs like to eat cats which is bad dont give them cats.
				Another way to make dogs like you is to pet them and take them for walks,
				but dont let them urinate on everything because dogs like that but its bad.
				Remember to <b>act</b> like a dog.</p>
